# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute! Please follow these:

- Branch naming: `feature/<short>-desc`, `fix/<short>-desc`
- Commit messages: use Conventional Commits (feat, fix, docs, chore)
- Open an issue first if it's a non-trivial feature; small fixes can go directly to PR
- Run linters & tests before submitting PR
